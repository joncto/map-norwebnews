# Map of Norwegian Web News (2005-)
This map presents Norwegian news sites geographically, based on the location of their (main) editorial board.

The data is derived from the Norwegian Web Archive's [*Register of Norwegian Web News (2005-)*, v.2022.11.07](./docs/norwebnews/README.md).

It is produced with QGIS 3.24, and the [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) plugin, with some post-editing of the html-, css- and js-files.

## How to use the map?
The map is available at the [Norwegian Web Archive's Map of Web News](https://nettarkivet.beta.nb.no/map/)
You can also inspect the [map in html preview](htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nlnwa/map-nettaviser/blob/main/index.html).

You can of course also down the files in this repo and run it locally.
After downloading, run 'index.html' in your browser.

All news sites are represented with a red dot. Clicking on it will display a pop-up window with the name of the publication and a link to Norwegian Web Archive, displaying indexed versions of the sites front page.
